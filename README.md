#Getting and Cleaning Data: Course Project (Coursera)
Sergio Carus, June 13th, 2015

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 
  

##Data Source
Data for the project was taken from:

##Project Summary
The script run_analysis.R does the following: 
- Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
- Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
- From the data set in step 4, creates a second, 
   independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

   
##Additional information
Information about the variables description, the data, and any transformations or work 
performed in order to clean up the data can be found in the file called CodeBook.md.
